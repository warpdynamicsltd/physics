# Introduction to Theoretical Physics

These are my private notes which help me to understand and remember some topics from theoretical physics. If you find them useful, it is my pleasure to be helpful in your learning or research process. However, don't be disappointed if not everything is to your liking -- they are only my personal notes, which just happen to be placed on github.com.

You can download pdf of my notes from here: <a href="https://github.com/warpdynamicsltd/physics/blob/main/main.pdf" title="Download" download>Download</a>
